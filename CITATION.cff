abstract: >
  Applying video recording to investigate behaviour of wild
  animals reduces field workload, enhances data accuracy,
  and minimises disturbance to animals. However, extracting
  information from collected video data remains a cumbersome
  and time-consuming task if not automated. Recent
  advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) for image
  processing offer promise in simplifying this process by
  identifying animal presence, tracking movement, and
  recognising individuals. Several platforms leveraging AI
  techniques have emerged to aid ecologists, yet a
  comprehensive tool for analysing behavioural videos with
  animal detection is still lacking. To address this gap, we
  introduce BEHAVE, an open-source, free, zero-install,
  AI-powered tool for coding animal behaviour in video
  recordings. BEHAVE allows a user with just a mid-range
  laptop to run state-of-the-art AI models that detect those
  frames of the video with animal presence, thus enabling
  the skipping of those parts of the video containing only a
  background. The detections can then be used in a
  user-friendly viewer to visually verify the presence and
  assess behaviour of the observed animals. The application
  also features a programmable ethogram and automatic
  timestamp/frame extraction.
