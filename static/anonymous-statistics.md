We believe that the internet should be a safe and private place, in order to come to greatness.
At the same time, it's important for us to know if, and how, BEHAVE is being used.
This way we can focus development efforts on those places where it's most needed.

We use the privacy-friendly [Insights](https://getinsights.io/){target=_blank} system to collect anonymous statistics.
They are [very open about what data they collect](https://getinsights.io/what-data-we-collect){target=_blank}.
They actively anonymize data, and don't share your behaviour on the site with anyone but us (meaning your visits are not recorded for advertising purposes).

Since we (or they) don't collect any personal data from you, we don't have a privacy policy (and, as you noticed, no EU cookie banner was needed either :)).

This website does not use persistent cookies, or track you over multiple sessions.
As soon as you close your browser, you are a new person to us.
Certain data (such as settings in the BEHAVE app) are stored (on your computer) over multiple sessions (so that you have the same settings next time you open the BEHAVE tools), but we don't use this data to track you.

This is our promise to you.
