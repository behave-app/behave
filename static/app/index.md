The BEHAVE app consists of three tools.
In order to get a full overview of the BEHAVE app, [read the homepage](../).

Normally one would first use the [infer page](infer.html) to go through the video and find the interesting and not interesting sections of the video.

Afterwards one uses the [BEHAVE UI](viewer.html) to code the behaviour on the video.

In case the video is not in MP4 format, it needs to be [converted](convert.html) first.
