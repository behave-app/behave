BEHAVE is a collection of tools that makes it easy to extract behaviour (or: code behaviour) from videos, especially long continuous videos, by employing state-of-the-art AI in order to determine which sections of the video can safely be skipped.

Applying video recording to investigate behaviour of wild animals reduces field workload, enhances data accuracy, and minimises disturbance to animals. However, extracting information from collected video data remains a cumbersome and time-consuming task if not automated. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) for image processing offer promise in simplifying this process by identifying animal presence, tracking movement, and recognising individuals. Several platforms leveraging AI techniques have emerged to aid ecologists, yet a comprehensive tool for analysing behavioural videos with animal detection is still lacking. To address this gap, we introduce BEHAVE, an open-source, free, zero-install, AI-powered tool for coding animal behaviour in video recordings. BEHAVE allows a user with just a mid-range laptop to run state-of-the-art AI models that detect those frames of the video with animal presence, thus enabling the skipping of those parts of the video containing only a background. The detections can then be used in a user-friendly viewer to visually verify the presence and assess behaviour of the observed animals. The application also features a programmable ethogram and automatic timestamp/frame extraction.
