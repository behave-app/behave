## Comparison between behaviour recording programs

There are multiple programs out there that can help researchers do behaviour recording.
On this page we try to show how a couple of the most used ones compare to BEHAVE.
This list is in no way meant to be exhaustive.
The authors do their best to keep the list up to date and accurate; feel free to [report](/contact) any omissions or inaccuracies to the authors.

In case some features are missing from BEHAVE that are essential for your project, please [contact us](/contact) and we can see if we can add it.
