## Hash in the filename

Many of the files that the BEHAVE tools create, are of the form `#original-filename#.#hash#.behave.#extension#`.
The "hash" section contains a string of 16 letters and numbers (e.g. `cb65f45f57c550f8`).
This string is generated by taking a [hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function){target=_blank} of the orginal video file.
This way the situation can be prevented that a detection file is used that does not belong to the video file that is loaded in, even if the video files have the same filename.

Unlike a normal hash, that uses the whole file, BEHAVE only looks at the first and last 5MB of the video file.
This is so that calculating the hash does not take too long in case the video is on a slow media (e.g. an SD card).
